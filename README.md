# Weather for OSRS
Ambient weather effects for your Old School Runescape experience.

## Features
- Rain effects (configurable)
- Snow effects (configurable)
- Lightning effects (configurable)
- Sound effects for weather types (on/off)

This plugin looks best with the Sky Box set to grey & GPU fog enabled to a thick level.

### Flash Warning
Lightning when enabled delivers some punchy flashes, just like real life. 
Lightning is off by default for safety reasons.

## Config
You can change most things; wind speed, thickness of droplets, dithering (falling sway), colour, speed of falling etc.

It *should* pause when you go inside.

## Call for Help!
Currently the sound effects are broken on the plugin-hub production build, but work when in development. If anyone's able to assist with this problem, please get involved! I'm at a loss & reckon there's something obvious I'm missing.

## Recent Activity & Future Plans
- **Broken sound effects** are being fixed (slowly), **help is really wanted here.**.
- **in-game location matching** is being considered, eg. Barbarian Village should be rainy.
- **3D style droplets** is being experimented with, please refer to the [Issue thread](https://github.com/bogstandard/rl-weather/issues/9#issue-1162733353)

The bundled tracks have been normalized, shrunk in size and reduced to mono. The originals above are much higher fidelity!

The Runescape from my childhood had weather, I'm sure of it.
